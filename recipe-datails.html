  <h3>Sushi</h3>
  <p>Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish made with vinegared rice and a variety of ingredients like raw fish, vegetables,<br> and sometimes tropical fruits. It originated in Japan as a way to preserve fish and has evolved into a refined culinary <br>art. Common forms include nigiri (fish on rice) and maki (fish and rice wrapped in seaweed). Sushi is often served<br> with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger. Its appeal lies in its fresh ingredients, simplicity, and health benefits, such<br> as being high in protein and low in fat. Sushi is not just food; it’s a cultural experience cherished worldwide.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Rinse 2 cups of sushi rice under cold water and cook it. Mix 1/4 cup rice vinegar, 2 tbsp sugar, and 1 tsp salt,<br>then stir into the rice once cooked.</li>
  <li>Slice fresh fish and vegetables (like cucumber, avocado, and carrots) into thin strips.</li>
  <li>Place a bamboo mat on a clean surface, and lay a sheet of nori (shiny side down) on it.</li>
  <li>Wet your hands and spread a thin layer of rice evenly over the nori, leaving about 1 inch at the top edge free of rice.</li>
  <li>Place fish and vegetable strips in the center, then roll the sushi tightly using the bamboo mat.</li>
  <li>Slice the roll into bite-sized pieces with a sharp knife, then serve with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger.</li><br></br>
