        <h3>Lasagna Food</h3>
        <img src="Food 2.jpeg" alt="Lasagna Food">
        <img src="Food 3.jpeg" alt="Lasagna Food">
        <p>Lasagna is one of Italy’s most iconic and beloved dishes, known and loved around the world.<br>
        This rich, layered pasta dish is a celebration of bold flavors and comforting textures. Traditionally<br>
        made with sheets of pasta, seasoned ground meat, rich tomato sauce, creamy béchamel (white sauce),<br>
        and generous layers of cheese—usually mozzarella and parmesan—lasagna is baked until golden and <br>bubbly.

        The origins of lasagna trace back to ancient Rome, but it was in Italy, particularly in the region<br> of Emilia-Romagna, where it became the dish we know today. Variations exist across different regions of Italy,<br> and modern adaptations include vegetarian, seafood, or even gluten-free versions.
        Lasagna is more than just food;<br> it’s a symbol of family gatherings, Sunday meals, and hearty comfort. Whether served in a rustic Italian<br> kitchen or a fine restaurant, lasagna continues to bring people together with its irresistible taste and timeless charm.</p>

        <img src="Food 7.jpeg" alt="croissant">
        <p>worldwide. Its delicate texture and rich flavor make it one of the most beloved breakfast treats in<br> France and beyond. While the croissant is often associated with France, its origins can be traced to Austria,<br> where it was first created in the 17th century.However, it was in France where it was refined and<br>popularized into the iconic pastry we know today.
        The croissant's journey to France began in 1837 <br>when an Austrian princess, Marie Antoinette, married the French King Louis XVI. She introduced<br> the kipferl, an Austrian crescent-shaped pastry, to the French court. Over time, French bakers adapted the recipe,<br> perfecting the dough by layering butter and folding it to create the flaky, puffed texture that croissants are famous for.</p>

          <h3>café latte</h3>

          <img src="Food 9.jpeg" alt="Cafee">
          <p>Known for its smooth and creamy texture, the latte combines espresso with steamed milk, creating a delicious<br> balance of strong coffee flavor and a velvety, rich mouthfeel. This beloved beverage is enjoyed by<br> coffee enthusiasts across various cultures and is often seen as a more approachable option for<br> those who may find straight espresso too strong.

          The origins of the café latte can be traced back<br> to Italy, where "caffè latte" means "coffee with milk." However, the modern latte as we know <br>it today was popularized in the United States during the 1980s, when it became a favorite among coffee drinkers<br> looking for a more indulgent, milder coffee experience. In its simplest form, a café latte consists of a single<br> shot of espresso topped with steamed milk, with a thin layer of milk foam on top.</p>
